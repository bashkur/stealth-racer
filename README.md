# Stealth Racer

This is a group project for Realtime 1 class. The task was to combine 2 genres, that don't usually get combined. Hence, stealth and racing.  

Drive around the track, racing against time. Stay stealthy by avoiding the street lights. Can you be the best?

Originally, the street lights were going to flicker to music to give the player some kind of clue of what's ahead. We had no idea how painful of a feature that would be to implement. After countless hours of trying to parse midi data using free libraries, the feature had to be cut. Now, the player gets only a visual heads-up: street lights flicker on and off for a short time before the lihgt fully turns on.
